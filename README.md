# WeatherNow
WeatherNow is a simple and modest weather app that allows input for the users location and displays the current weather accordingly. It uses the OpenWeather API to achieve this and is one of the project apps I have created as I learn about swift and developing IOS applications. 

### Interface
Depending on the city input at the top by the user, the text displaying the temperature and the icon displaying the current weather status for the chosen location will update.
